⚠️ **Note: This project is currently under construction and is not yet active.** ⚠️

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation CNA is a collaborative
effort to assign and maintain [CVE](https://www.cve.org/) identifiers within the
ecosystem, providing a consistent and transparent process for reporting,
documenting, and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

As a [CNA (CVE Numbering Authority)](https://www.cve.org/programorganization/cnas),
this initiative encompasses [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/),
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm),
and [Hex.pm packages](https://hex.pm/packages) hosted by the
[Erlang Ecosystem Foundation’s Security Working Group](https://erlef.org/wg/security).

By following the globally recognized CVE standard, this joint venture ensures a
unified approach to identifying and addressing security issues across these
communities.
